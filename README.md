# Introduction
Steel is a lightweight framework which allows for developers to have a drop-in MVC solution.

# Installation
To install the framework, youâ€™ll want to make sure that you have a web server with mod_rewrite and PHP 7. (Steel may run on older versions but is developed on PHP 7)

Download the latest version of Steel from https://github.com/EricRabil/steel-framework/archive/master.zip and unzip it to wherever you want to store your web documents. Then, update your web server to make only the **public** directory available (make it your DocumentRoot)

Now, you can get started on the framework at https://github.com/EricRabil/steel-framework/wiki/Getting-Started
